Welcome to my small workspace, I am Utsav Desai, a student of IIT Bombay, where I am pursuing B.Tech in Mechanical along with an M.Tech in AI and Data Science. You can contact me at: [utsavmdesai@gmail.com](mailto:utsavmdesai@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/utsav-m-desai/) for any questions.

In this repository you can find all of my mini projects related mainly related to computer vision.

# [TicTacToe](/TicTacToe/)

This is a simple TicTacToe game, but it is played using the webcam and hands. I have used Google's Mediapipe for determining the hand coordinated and then some basic Computer Vision/Image Processing tools.(PS: This project was completed in 1 hr :P)




# [Doc scanner](/doc_scanner/)

This is a camera module which can be used scan the documents. You can upload any image of a document, and the code will run some image processing on it to identify the corners and align it with the screen and save the final image in the same folder.
